# Snake Game - Demo for CI/CD & Kubernetes

> ⚠️ Note: I did **not develop the Snake game itself**.  
> This repository is used purely to **demonstrate CI/CD pipelines, GitOps, and Kubernetes deployments**.  
> The original game was created by a friend, and I am using it here as a sample application.
